## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

```html
<div><button class="button"><p class="continue">Continue</p></button></div>
```
This part of HTML was interesting because I used three tags in one line of code, which allowed me to apply multiple CSS classes to one aspect of my program.

```css
#gradient-circle {
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
}
```
#gradient-circle was something new I learned because I had never made a gradient in CSS before.

``` css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'HankenGrotesk';
  src: url('assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf');
}
```
Working with pre-imported fonts was also new to me, so I had to research the syntax to add the multiple fonts to the code.

### Continued development
These are some things I want to improve on:
- Mobile View: Having a better mobile view will allow users to view the website on any device, so I hope to learn more about ems to apply them to my projects.
- Headers and Divs: Headers and divs help group together portions of the code, so improving these would help me move and position large portions of the code.
- JavaScript: JavaScript would provide a more dymanic website interaction compared to JavaScript, as it would prevent me from having to hard-code projects,

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Gradients](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) - This helped me learn how to make gradients in CSS.
- [W3Schools CSS Font-Face](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_font-face.php) - This helped me learn the syntax required to use imported fonts.
