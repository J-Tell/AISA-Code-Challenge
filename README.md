## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

```html
<div><button class="button"><p class="continue">Continue</p></button></div>
```
This part of HTML was interesting because I used three tags in one line of code, which allowed me to apply multiple CSS classes to one aspect of my program.

```css
#gradient-circle {
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'HankenGrotesk';
  src: url('assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf');
}
```
#gradient-circle was something new I learned because I had never made a gradient in CSS before.

Working with pre-imported fonts was also new to me, so I had to research the syntax to add the multiple fonts to the code.

### Continued development
