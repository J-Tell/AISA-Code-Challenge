# AISA Solution Front-End Engineer Intern Challenge - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for Applying for AISA Solutions Front-End Engineer Intern opportunity.


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

Want some support on the challenge? [Send email to alireza.paziresh@aisa.solutions](alireza.paziresh@aisa.solutions) and ask your questions.
## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Deploying your project

There are many ways to deploy your challenge. Our recommended way is:

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Once you've completed the development work, create a new repository on your personal GitHub account and deploy your solution there. This will allow us to review your work and see how you've approached the challenge.


## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

After you have finished the challenge deploy on your github and send us an email to alireza.paziresh@aisa.solutions with the link to your solution.

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our Product and interview process. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email info@aisa.solutions

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
